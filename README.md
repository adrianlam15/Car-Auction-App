# Car Auction House

### | **Introduction**
Welcome to the Car Auction House application, a middleman platform for buyers and sellers to participate in car auctions. 
The application allows users to create listings for cars they would like to auction and bid on cars they would like to buy. The car will be sold to the highest bid after the countdown for the auction has ended.

### | **Features**
- Create listings for cars to be auctioned
- Place bids on cars for sale
- Browse listings by category (exotic, old, vintage, Japanese imports, etc.)
- Easy-to-use interface for buying and selling cars

### | **Target Users**
This application is designed for individuals who are interested in buying or selling cars from a range of categories. It is perfect for those who want to purchase a specific car but have been unable to due to the complications of online auction houses and the lack in
options when shopping locally.

### | **Why this project is important**
This project is important to me as a developer because I want to create an application that simplifies the process of buying and selling second-hand cars. The goal is to make the experience of participating in car auctions more seamless and user-friendly for everyone involved.

### | **Tech Stack**
This application will be built using Java.
